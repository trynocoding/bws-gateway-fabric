# verify-rbac-sync.sh - Verify operator RBAC includes all permissions from NGF Helm chart
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT IS NECESSARY:
#
# The operator RBAC (operators/config/rbac/role.yaml) must be a superset of the NGF Helm chart
# RBAC (charts/bws-gateway-fabric/templates/clusterrole.yaml) because:
#
# 1. The operator deploys NGF, so it needs all permissions NGF requires to function
# 2. The operator needs additional permissions to manage Deployments, Services, CRDs, etc.
# 3. The Helm chart has CONDITIONAL permissions based on feature flags that may or may not
#    be enabled at runtime (experimental features, snippets, telemetry, NGINX Plus, etc.)
#
# WHY WE CAN'T DO A SIMPLE FILE COMPARISON:
#
# - The Helm chart is a TEMPLATE with conditionals ({{- if .Values.foo }}) and variables
# - The operator needs a SUPERSET of permissions (NGF + operator-specific)
# - The operator uses wildcard verbs (verbs: ["*"]) while Helm uses explicit verbs
# - The Helm chart permissions change based on feature flags at deployment time
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#
# 1. Renders the Helm chart with ALL features enabled to get the maximum set of permissions
# 2. Extracts all possible permissions NGF might need (across all feature combinations)
# 3. Verifies the operator RBAC includes all these permissions (either explicitly or via wildcards)
# 4. Reports any missing permissions that would cause the operator to fail
#
# This ensures the operator will work correctly regardless of which NGF features are enabled.

# BWS Gateway Fabric Operator

A Helm-based Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing BWS Gateway Fabric.

## Overview

The BWS Gateway Fabric Operator simplifies deployment and lifecycle management of BWS Gateway Fabric in Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.

## Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Manage BWS Gateway Fabric through Kubernetes custom resources
- **Helm Chart Integration**: Uses the BWS Gateway Fabric Helm chart
- **OpenShift Compatible**: Certified for Red Hat OpenShift with proper SecurityContextConstraints
- **BWS API Contract**: Uses `gateway.bessystem.com` and BWS Helm values, including:
  - Experimental Gateway API features
  - Multiple deployment modes (Deployment/DaemonSet)

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.25+ or OpenShift 4.19+
- Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installed
- Gateway API CRDs installed

## Installation

### OpenShift OperatorHub

1. Navigate to OperatorHub in your OpenShift console
2. Search for "NGINX Gateway Fabric Operator"
3. Install the operator

## Usage

### Basic Installation

Create a `BwsGatewayFabric` custom resource to deploy BWS Gateway Fabric:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.bessystem.com/v1alpha1
kind: BwsGatewayFabric
metadata:
  name: bws-gateway-fabric
spec:
  bwsGateway:
    replicas: 2
    gatewayClassName: bws
  bws:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
```

See [the example here](config/samples/gateway_v1alpha1_bwsgatewayfabric.yaml).

## Configuration Reference

The `BwsGatewayFabric` custom resource accepts the same configuration options as the BWS Gateway Fabric Helm chart.

For complete configuration options, see the [Helm Chart Documentation](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/main/charts/bws-gateway-fabric/README.md#configuration).

## Development

### Building and Testing the Operator Locally

```bash
# Build the operator image. If building for deploying on a cluster with different architecture from your local machine, append ARCH=<targetarch> e.g. `ARCH=amd64` to the below command
make docker-build IMG=<your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator:<tag>

# Push the image
make docker-push IMG=<your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator:<tag>

# Optionally load the image if running on kind
make docker-load IMG=<your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator:<tag>

# Generate and push bundle (must be publicly accessible remote registry, e.g. quay.io)
make bundle-build bundle-push IMG=<your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator:<tag> BUNDLE_IMG=<your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator-bundle:<tag>

# Install olm on local cluster if required (e.g. if running on kind)
operator-sdk olm install

# Run your bundle image
operator-sdk run bundle <your-registry>/nginx-gateway-fabric/operator-bundle:<tag>

# Deploy NGF operand (modify the manifest if required)
kubectl apply -f config/samples/gateway_v1alpha1_bwsgatewayfabric.yaml

# Deploy test application
kubectl apply -f ../examples/cafe-example/

# Run operator-sdk scorecard - optional
make bundle
operator-sdk scorecard bundle/
```

### Releases

The Operator release process is largely automated. Once NGF has released, follow these steps:

#### Automated Release Process

1. Production Release: During the NGF production release (via the CI workflow), set the `operator_version` input to the new operator version (e.g., `v1.0.1`). This will:
   - Build and push the operator image with the release tag
   - Automatically submit the operator UBI image for RedHat certification via preflight

2. Bundle Generation: After the production release completes, run the [Operator Bundle PR workflow](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/actions/workflows/operator-bundle-pr.yml):
   - Set `operator-version` to the operator version without the `v` prefix (e.g., `1.0.1`)
   - Set `submit-to-redhat` to `true` to automatically submit to the RedHat certified-operators repository

   This workflow will:
   - Generate bundle manifests with NGF image versions updated to use image digests
   - Create a draft PR in the NGF repository with the bundle changes
   - If enabled, automatically:
     - Fork and update the [RedHat certified-operators repository](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators)
     - Create a branch with the new bundle version
     - Open a PR to the upstream certified-operators repo

3. Review and Merge:
   - Review and merge the internal bundle PR once approved
   - Monitor the RedHat certified-operators PR for review feedback from RedHat
   - Ensure the bundle PR changes are duplicated back to the main branch as well

#### RBAC Synchronization

The Operator requires RBAC rules that include:

- Permissions for anything the NGF Helm chart can deploy (e.g. Pods, ConfigMaps, Gateways, HPAs, etc)
- All permissions that NGF itself has (e.g. all the Gateway API resources)

Automated Verification: A CI check runs automatically on PRs that modify RBAC files to ensure the operator RBAC includes all permissions from the Helm chart. You can also verify locally:

```bash
./operators/scripts/verify-rbac-sync.sh
```

The verification script:

- Renders the Helm chart with all features enabled to extract the maximum permission set
- Compares operator RBAC permissions with the rendered chart
- Handles wildcard permissions (`verbs: ["*"]`) correctly
- Fails if any required permissions are missing

If RBAC permissions in the Helm chart change, update [config/rbac/role.yaml](config/rbac/role.yaml) accordingly. The next time `make bundle` runs, these RBAC changes will be reflected in the bundle manifests.

#### Manual Items to Check

Before releasing, verify these items are up-to-date:

1. Sample manifest: The [example manifest](config/samples/gateway_v1alpha1_bwsgatewayfabric.yaml) may need updates to add new important fields or change existing entries.

2. Operator version: The VERSION in the [Makefile](Makefile) is automatically updated during the release process, but verify it matches the intended release version.

#### Local Testing

To test the operator bundle locally before releasing, follow the [Building and Testing the Operator Locally](#building-and-testing-the-operator-locally) instructions above.
